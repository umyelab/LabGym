**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/umyelab/LabGym/compare/v2.9.0...v2.9.1>

## v2.9.0
### What's Changed
* Introduced a new annotation tool: [EZannot](https://github.com/yujiahu415/EZannot), to replace Roboflow since Roboflow started to charge for private data.
* Further optimized Categorizer training to improve its generalizibility.
* Fixed bugs.

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/umyelab/LabGym/compare/v2.8.1...v2.9.0>

## v2.8.1
### What's Changed
* Prevented interruption of the analysis when Detector fails.
* Now LabGym can analyze interactive behaviors that an object/animal is inside an specific area (the Detector can detect both the object/animal and the area even if the object/animal is inside that area).

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/umyelab/LabGym/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1>

## v2.8.0
### What's Changed
* Further optimized Categorizer training to improve its accuracy and generalizibility.
* Significantly increased the data amount of augmentation when training a Categorizer. As a result, training a Categorizer requires less sorted behavior examples.
* Since the data amount of augmentation significantly increased, larger memory is required to train a Categorizer if loading all training examples into memory. Therefore, users can now export the augmented training examples to a folder and train a Categorizer without requiring a lot of memory but at slower speed. The exported training examples can also be directly used for future training without performing augmentation again.
* Implemented a sorting method that uses a '.csv' file that stores the frame-wise behavioral labels to sort the unsorted behavior examples generated by LabGym. As a result, users can use behavioral annotations from other tools to automatically sort behavior examples in LabGym.
* Added a 'draw lines' function to the 'Draw Markers' functional unit so that users can draw both lines and circles to mark a specific location in videos.

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/umyelab/LabGym/commits/v2.3.0>

## v2.2

1. Added functions of testing Detectors / Categorizers so that the accuracy of a trained Detector / Categorizer can be tested and reported.
2. Added behavior mode 'Static image' so that LabGym can now analyze behaviors in static images.
3. Made the spreadsheets for storing behavioral metrics transposed so that they can be more compatible with other platforms.
4. Other minor optimizations.

## v2.1

1. Improved the user interface and the Extended User Guide. 
2. Added a tutorial video.

## v2.0

1. Implemented the analysis pipeline for complex interactive behaviors. 
2. Major improvement on analysis speed.
3. Bug fix.

## v1.9

1. Implemented Detector-based detection method. Now the changing background or illumination in videos is no longer a problem for LabGym. 
2. Implemented data mining functional unit.
3. Implemented preprocessing functional unit.
4. Simplified code and further optimized the processing speed.
5. Implemented basic analysis for interactive behavior.

## v1.8

1. In previous versions, if no animal is detected in a frame, this frame will be skipped. From now on, such frames will not be skipped, and the behavioral classification and quantification will be output as 'NA's so that the raster plots and the quantification results can be perfectly aligned for every frame with other data (e.g., ephys recordings).
2. An 'uncertain level' can be added into the Categorizers for reducing the false positives in behavior classification. The Categorizer will output an ‘NA’ if the difference between probability of the highest-likely behavior and the second highest-likely behavior is less than the uncertainty level.
3. Simplified the user interface. 
4. Optimized the processing speed.

## v1.7

1. Improved the background extraction and the tracking, making them faster and more accurate. 

## v1.6

1. Added a version checker. If a newer version of LabGym is available, users will see a reminder when initiate the user interface. 

## v1.5

1. Simplified the user interface and made it more self-illustrative.
2. Added an option of whether to output the distances in pixels when calculating behavior parameters. Previously all the distances were just normalized by the size of a single animal.

## v1.4

1. Made the time points in the output time-series sheets more precise.
2. Fixed an error when using the option of 'load background image'.

## v1.3

1. Improved background subtraction and the tracking is more accurate.
2. Now LabGym not only can work for videos with illumination transitions from dark to bright, but can also work for those from bright to dark.

## v1.2

1. Now LabGym can also be used in categorizing binary behaviors (yes or no behavior, or behaviors with only 2 categories)
2. Fixed a bug that caused a path error if users did not select any behavior parameters for quantification.
3. Now users have an option to choose whether to relink newly detected animals to deregistered IDs.

## v1.1

1. Changed a typo in setup.

## v1.0

Initial release.
