By default, detectron2 imports cv2 (opencv-python), and coverage 
analysis with pytest-cov (which uses "coverage"), produces warnings 
regarding two cv2 py-files
    .../site-packages/cv2/config-3.py
    .../site-packages/cv2/config.py
like
    .../site-packages/coverage/report_core.py:113: 
    CoverageWarning: Couldn't parse ...: No source for code: '.../LabGym/LabGym/tests/config-3.py'.
    (couldnt-parse); see https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.10.7/messages.html#warning-couldnt-parse
      coverage._warn(msg, slug="couldnt-parse")
    .../site-packages/coverage/report_core.py:113: 
    CoverageWarning: Couldn't parse ...: No source for code: '.../LabGym/LabGym/tests/config.py'.
    (couldnt-parse); see https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.10.7/messages.html#warning-couldnt-parse
      coverage._warn(msg, slug="couldnt-parse")
because coverage is looking for the source in cwd, instead of in 
site-packages/cv2.

    "cv2 import has pytest-cov looking for two source files in cwd 
    instead of in site-packages/cv2"

This was reported to opencv/opencv on 2025-10-04.
See https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/27867
    "Ambitious meta programming in opencv-python produces warnings from 
    coverage analysis static analysis tool."

Workarounds to avoid the two coverage warnings during coverage analysis
include:

1.  In the test module (the unit test testfile), disable detectron2's 
    import of cv2, like this:

        # Avoid two coverage warnings from detectron2's import of cv2.
        # (see Notes.opencv-python-and-coverage-warnings.txt)
        os.environ['DETECTRON2_DISABLE_CV2'] = '1'  # use '1' for True here.

        from LabGym.detectron2 import model_zoo
        from LabGym.detectron2.config import get_cfg
        from LabGym.detectron2.modeling import build_model

2.  Use warning filters.

    Warning filters can be specified
    (a) as options on the pytest command line, like this:

            pytest --cov=.. \
                -W ignore:"Couldn't parse '$PWD/config-3.py'":coverage.exceptions.CoverageWarning \
                -W ignore:"Couldn't parse '$PWD/config.py'":coverage.exceptions.CoverageWarning

    (b) or, specified with filterwarnings and a regex in 
        pytest.ini or pyproject.toml, like this:

            # pytest.ini
            [pytest]
            # Avoid two coverage warnings from detectron2's import of cv2.
            # (see Notes.opencv-python-and-coverage-warnings.txt)
            filterwarnings =
                ignore:Couldn't parse .*/config-3.py:coverage.exceptions.CoverageWarning
                ignore:Couldn't parse .*/config.py:coverage.exceptions.CoverageWarning
